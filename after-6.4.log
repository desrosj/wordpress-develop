    Block Hooks: Store ignored hooked blocks metadata in anchor block.
    
    The biggest tradeoff that was made in the implementation of Block Hooks was that they were limited to layouts (i.e. templates, template parts, and patterns) that ''didn't have any user modifications'' (see #59313 for the reason). This changeset is a preparatory step to remove this limitation, so they’ll eventually also work with user-modified layouts.
    
    The crucial problem to solve is how to acknowledge that a user has opted to remove or persist a hooked block, so that the auto-insertion mechanism won't run again and inject an extraneous hooked block on the frontend when none is solicited.
    
    This is achieved by storing all known blocks hooked to a given anchor block in the `metadata` attribute on that anchor block; specifically in a field called `ignoredHookedBlocks` inside of the `metadata`. Hooked blocks are only rendered on the frontend if they're absent from that field; OTOH, they're injected into that field (via the REST API) when first loaded in the editor.
    
    This simple logic guarantees that once a user modifies a given layout, those changes are respected on the frontend; yet if a plugin that includes a hooked block is activated after those modifications have taken place, the hooked block will be rendered on the frontend. This new technique supplants the one previously used (i.e. rendering hooked blocks on the frontend only if a layout doesn't have any modifications) in a rather direct way.
    
    Note that this changeset only introduces the new metadata field and relevant logic; it does not yet enable hooked block insertion into modified layouts. That will be done in a subsequent step (see #59646).
    
    Props gziolo.
    Closes #60008.

    Build/Test Tools: Update the MariaDB test strategy matrix.
    
    This updates the test strategy matrix in the PHPUnit test GitHub Actions workflow to include the most recent MariaDB release, 11.2.
    
    While 11.0 and 11.1 are still maintained, all three are short-term stable releases, which see support dropped after 1 year.
    
    Until a larger discussion around how the project supports database software releases with shorter support windows takes place (short-term in MariaDB or “innovation” releases in MySQL), testing only against the latest short-term release should be sufficient.

    REST API: Restore site logo and icon in index.
    
    Restores setting the site's logo, icon, and wp-admin's back button image (which defaults to W).
    
    Prior to [56566], the site logo and icon were unconditionally added to the index. [56566] changed this by conditionally adding them if either the `_links` or `_embedded` fields were included. However, these fields are not included when using the Site Logo block, as it uses the `site_logo`, `site_icon`, and `site_icon_url` fields instead.
    
    This changeset restores the functionality by checking specifically for the `site_*` fields when neither of the `_links` or `_embedded` fields are present.

    * Use `assertSame()` to verify the type of the result.
    * Use `data_` prefix for the data provider.
    * Use named data set in the data provider. This makes the output when using the `--testdox` option more descriptive and is helpful when trying to debug which data set from a data provider failed the test.

    External Libraries: Upgrade PHPMailer to version 6.9.1.
    
    This is a maintenance and feature release, adding support for the official release of PHP 8.3, methods for removing and replacing custom headers, XCLIENT support, and links to a new way of implementing XOAUTH2 authentication.
    
    The only change likely to have any impact on existing code is that PHPMailer previously attempted to use opportunistic STARTTLS encryption when connecting to `localhost`, which was unlikely to work. The workaround required setting `SMTPAutoTLS = false`, but that's no longer required. You may still need to use this setting when connecting to literal IPs.

    Build/Test Tools: Run unit tests using new MySQL versions.
    
    The MySQL project has introduced a new versioning strategy with two types of releases: innovation and long-term support. While long-term support is a familiar concept, it’s not clear how innovation releases should be supported in various WordPress versions for a number of reasons.
    
    Mainly, innovation releases are very short-lived. Each one is only supported until the next innovation version is released with a goal of one per quarter. Even though these versions will have a short lifespan they are described as producton-grade and generally available.
    
    More discussion is needed to determine exactly how each WordPress release should support these new innovation releases. But while the parameters for proper support are determined, the PHPUnit tests can be run against these innovation releases to detect any potential problems or incompatibilities.
    
    This change adds the `8.1` and `8.2` innovation releases to the testing matrix for the PHPUnit test worfklow.

    General: Rename `wp_json_encode()` parameters for parity with PHP Core.
    
    `wp_json_encode()` is a wrapper for the PHP native `json_encode()` function with some extra safety checks.
    
    This commit renames the `$data` parameter in the `wp_json_encode()` function and associated functions to `$value`, and the `$options` parameter to `$flags` for parity with the parameter names used in PHP Core.

    Administration: Standardize default values in `submit_button()`.
    
    This commit updates the `submit_button()` function to standardize the default values of `$text` and `$other_attributes` parameters. Previously set to `null`, these defaults have now been changed to an empty string (`''`), bringing consistency with the `get_submit_button()` function, which `submit_button()` wraps.
    
    The change maintains backward compatibility, as `get_submit_button()` does not perform strict type-checking on these parameters. This update aligns with the ongoing effort to standardize function parameters across the WordPress codebase, improving the readability and predictability of the core functions.

    Build/Test Tools: Comment on PRs with WordPress Playground information.
    
    After [56958], pull requests to `wordpress-develop` can be tested within a WordPress Playground instance. However this capability is not obvious.
    
    This makes several updates to GitHub action workflows to avoid unnecessary extra runs/jobs while also commenting on pull requests with proper context for testing in Playground once a build is available for the PR.
    
    Changes:
    - The `build.yml` workflow has been deleted. The WordPress build process is already being tested within the `test-build-processes.yml` workflow. Now that workflow will produce and upload the built artifact for the given PR.
    - A `pull-request-comments.yml` workflow has been added to handle the commenting. To avoid having multiple workflows that comment on PRs, the logic within the `welcome-new-contributors.yml` workflow has been merged into this one.
    - The `pull_request` event trigger lacks the needed permission to comment on or update pull requests. Instead of using `pull_request_target` to navigate around this, the `test-build-processes.yml` workflow will now use `workflow_dispatch` to initiate a run of the commenting workflow. This adds the ability to only comment on the PR when a build has been successfully created and uploaded as an artifact.

    Twenty Twenty-One: Update all dependencies.
    
    In preparation for updating Core to use Node.js version 18.x, this updates the dependancies for the Twenty Twenty-One theme to the latest versions. This addresses an unsupported engine warning where packages within the dependency tree did not support Node.js > 16.x.
    
    All changes to built files are included in this commit. These changes are a result of the following:
    
    - Identical sets of properties for multiple selectors are now consolidated into one.
    - The removal of a duplicate `--branding--description--font-family` definition.
    - The addition of the `postcss-discard-empty` dependency, which removes empty CSS rules within IE stylesheets after the previous consolidation is performed.
    - `stylelint` has only been updated to 14.x (15.x is the latest). This is because `@wordpres/stylelint-config` currently has a version constraint of `^14.2` and does not properly support 15.x.
    
    The last change of note is the new configuration for the `value-keyword-case` rule in `.stylelint-css.json`. This was added as a way to prevent the `currentColor` from being changed to all lowercase.

    Block Hooks: Expose serialized template content to filter.
    
    The recently introduced Block Hooks API exposes a filter (`hooked_block_types`) which is given a `$context` argument, among others. If the filter is called on a block that's part of a template or template part, `$context` is set to the corresponding `WP_Block_Template` object.
    
    However, that object's `$content` property is currently ''not'' exposed to the filter. This changeset amends that shortcoming.
    
    This is useful for callbacks that might want to detect the presence of a serialized block instance (or potentially in the future utilize the HTML API) to restrict where the block is injected (before the template is rendered).
    
    Addressing this also achieves parity with the structure of `$context` when it represents a pattern (where pattern serialized content is present).

    HTML API: Add support for containers elements, including ARTICLE.
    
    There are a handful of elements which behave similarly and are generically container elements. These are the following elements:

    Docs: Fix various incorrect WP-flavored array specifications.
    
    Tags like `@string` or `@array` do not exist and are not supported. The way these were used here, also meant duplicate information being documented.
    
    Fixed now by using the `@type` tag as per the WP flavor of array documentation.
    
    Includes some fixes to the documentation formatting.

    Database: Reinstate wpdb::$use_mysqli property.
    
    Partial revert of [56475] to reinstate the private `wpdb::$use_mysqli` property and set to its default to `true`. This private property was / is accessible through the magic methods. Though Core's usage of this property was removed by [56475], plugins are using the property. Reinstating it resolves the BC break.
